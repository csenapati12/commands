1. Whether we can have multiple steps/stages in declarative pipeline?
   No, We can't use, its against the syntax
2. Difference between scripted and declarative pipeline, which is more used or adviced to use 
3. In declarative pipeline agent any and agent none, how can we differentiate
    agent any means, any avialable agent for the complete pipeline or specific stage, agent none means, no global agent is available for the pipeline and each stage can have their own agent.
    Else by default it will take the default master
4. Whether you can use multiple agents in a declarative/scripted pipeline(Y/N), if yes syntax please
    You can have multiple agents in pipeline job
