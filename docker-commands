docker ps -a | grep "Exited" | awk "{print}"  --->to list download Exited container
docker images | grep "<none>" | awk "{print \$3}"  -->list down not used commands



what is a dangling image
===============================
Dangling images, are layers that have no relationship to any tagged images. 
So the old images you have becomes the "dangling image". 
Those old image are the ones that are untagged and displays "<none>" on its name when you run docker images.
They no longer serve a purpose and consume disk space.
to remove the dangling images need to run below command



docker image prune -a
docker images --quiet --filter=dangling=true | xargs --no-run-if-empty docker rmi
docker system prune -a(delete all the images except the runnning the container)
